# CodeClauseInternship_FraudDetection
Credit Card Fraud Detection project completed during CodeClause Data Science Internship (Dec 2025)

# Fraud Detection – CodeClause Internship (Entry Level)
This repository contains my **Entry Level Machine Learning Project** for the CodeClause Data Science Internship (Dec 2025).

## 📌 Project Title
Fraud Detection

## 📌 Objective
To build a machine learning model that identifies fraudulent credit card transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset.

## 📌 Features of This Project
- Data Cleaning & Exploration  
- Handling Imbalanced Dataset  
- Logistic Regression Model  
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall & F1 Score  
- Confusion Matrix Visualization  

## 📌 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project
1. Open the project notebook in Google Colab.
2. Upload the dataset file named `creditcard.csv` using the file upload option.
3. Run all cells one-by-one from top to bottom.
4. The model will train automatically and show:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1 Score
   - Confusion Matrix
5. Check the output cells to view the evaluation and graphs.
