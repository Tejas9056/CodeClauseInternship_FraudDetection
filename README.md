# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection – CodeClause Internship (Entry Level)
This repository contains my **Entry-Level Machine Learning Project** for the CodeClause Data Science Internship (Dec 2025).
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using an imbalanced dataset. The model is trained and tested using Python in Google Colab.

## 📌 Project Title
**Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression**

## 🚩 Problem Statement
Credit card fraud is a major challenge for banks and customers, as fraudulent transactions can lead to financial losses. The dataset contains very few fraud cases compared to normal transactions, making it a difficult and imbalanced classification problem. This project aims to build a model that can identify fraud while handling the class imbalance efficiently.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset** from Kaggle.

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project
1. Open the Google Colab notebook:  
   👉 `Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb`
2. Upload the dataset file (`creditcard.csv`) when prompted.
3. Run all cells one by one from top to bottom.
4. The notebook will train the model and display:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1 Score
   - Confusion Matrix
